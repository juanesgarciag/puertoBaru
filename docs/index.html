He is the visionary behind Puerto Baru back in the 1960’s as well as dozens of other projects and businesses in numerous countries around the world. Mr. Ludwig planted over 10,000 acres of citrus trees in the Chiriquí Province.</p> <p class="history__text-p">He dredged the river mouth to the port location. His goal was to bring in tankers, load them up with oranges and process the oranges into concentrate on his tankers and deliver them to markets around the world. Unfortunately, his project was nationalized in the late 80’s and his plan never came to fruition. The site was eventually auctioned off by the Panamanian government and picked up by a private landowner where it sat dormant.</p> <p class="history__text-p">After a half dozen years of studies, reports and negotiations, we were able to take control of the property and continue with Daniel Ludwig’s vision of creating a feeder port to service the Chiriquí Province and beyond.</p> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="services"> <div class="fuel"> <h3>fuel storage <br> & logistics</h3> </div> <div class="commercial"> <h3>commercial <br> cargo</h3> </div> <div class="sand"> <h3>sand concession <br> & storage</h3> </div> <div class="grain"> <h3>grain</h3> </div> <div class="tourism"> <h3>tourism</h3> </div> </section> <section class="project" id="project"> <h2 class="project__title">the project</h2> <div class="container"> <div class="project__text"> <h2 class="project__text-title">we connect possibilities</h2> <p class="project__text-p">Puerto Barú Multimodal will export agricultural goods and import containers, fuel, sand, fertilizer, bulk goods, farm equipment and grain.

The combination of massive protected mangroves, the inability to find protected water areas as well as disconnect between the private and public sector, has made finding any potential feeder port in the area extremely difficult.</p> </div> <div class="project__text-button"> <a href="#">contact us</a> </div> </div> </section> <section class="trips"> <div class="trips__counter"> <img src="isoLogo.1c7909c9.png" alt="" class="trips__counter-img"> <h2 class="trip__counter-number">730,000</h2> <img src="isoLogo.1c7909c9.png" alt="" class="trips__counter-img2"> </div> <p class="trip-text">Annual truck trips to and <br> from David, Chirquí.</p> </section> <section class="team" id="team"> <h2 class="team__title">the team</h2> <div class="container team_dist"> <div class="team__ceo"> <h2 class="team__ceo-title">Puerto Barú is spearheaded <br> by Alberto Alemán Zubieta.</h2> <div class="team__ceo-face1"> <div class="team__ceo-face1-img">  </div> </div> <div class="team__ceo-text"> <p class="team__ceo-text-p p1"><span>Alberto Alemán Zubieta</span> is the former CEO of the Panama Canal Authority, the autonomous agency that manages the Panama Canal, the leading interoceanic waterway that serves world maritime commerce. </p> <p class="team__ceo-text-p p2">Alberto Alemán Zubieta began his professional career in the construction field.
